For this project, we wanted to add the ability to hold down the mouse buttons to repeatedly place/remove blocks, instead of having to click repeatedly, and to allow custom key-binding that persists between game sessions.

All changes were made to main.c, in particular the on_mouse_click(), on_key(), load_controls_text(), load_controls_default(), save_controls(), change_key(), parse_command(), and main() functions. Almost all comments besides the TODO comments and header comments such as // INITIALIZATION // are mine, which should aid in finding the code that was added.
